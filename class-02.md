#### Headings
  * HTML has 6 levels of heading from h1 to h6.
  * the most important heading and the biggest heading is `<h1></h1>` and there is only h1 in the page and it's usually the title of the webpage.
  * these headings arranged from most important to least important, which means the least important heading on the page is `<h6></h6>`.
