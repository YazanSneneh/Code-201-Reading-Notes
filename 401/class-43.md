# Ethics In Tech

### The code I’m still ashamed of (Ethics in the workplace)
   - Ethical behaviour is more important than work ethics because if I break my code I will probably write article on it on the future on how bad I feel.
   - I should always think of the nature of the work I am doing because it's my responsiblity to use what i know to serve good (at least I don't cheat on people for money).
   - these ethics exist for a good reason, if i break them i might do something lead to disaster (like the man in the article, he killed a young girl with his pure stupidty) she took a medicine with side effect lead to her death, so back to the point ethics exist for a reason and instinctively we should feel wrong about it and when we do, we should act accodringly.
   - the last defence line is developers (it is important to be responsible as well).

##### my personal opion
- everyone in that story i guitly!, and judge is good thing on grown up people recklessly killed someone.
- diagnosing should not be done by a survey because in such sensetive job nature, some human interaction matters !!!!
###  The cybersecurity risk of self-driving cars (Ethics in Technology)
- any computerized system that has an interface to the outside world is potentially hackable, Any computer scientist knows that it is very difficult to create software without any bugs (because bugs lived in our minds in the first before they lived in the system).
- hacking cars is something really scary (they can commit crimes behind the keyboard).
- The government, needs to be involved, but it is incredibly difficult to test an existing complex system and certify that it is secure.

##### my personal opion
 - it's clearly not save to live between self driving cars unless we have immune to hacking system.
 - and hackers are critical thinkers by nature and result of finding out the problem is always late (I mean hacker already achieved what they want from the system) so if cars are hacked we can visualize others intents(their true color :P).
